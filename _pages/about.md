Hi! I am a [pre-doctoral fellow](https://fordschool.umich.edu/mozambique-research/research-team) (under [Professor Dean Yang](https://fordschool.umich.edu/faculty/dean-yang)) and an [African Presidential Scholars alumnus](https://ii.umich.edu/asc/umaps/fellows/winter22-umaps.html) at the [University of Michigan - Ann Arbor](https://umich.edu/). I hold a position of Lecturer in Economics (tenure track) at the [University of Malawi](https://www.unima.ac.mw/departments/economics), and have experience consulting with various organizations and international financial institutions, such as the World Bank. I have held various leadership positions in academic, workplace and in other settings; working with different development partners, government departments, and other organizations and institutions involved in high-level research and development activities.

I was born, raised and educated up to the Masterâ€™s level in Malawi, a low income country. My life experience has seen my passion for research and international development grow.  I am looking to get into a doctoral program in an Economics-related program with interests in development.
