In January 2021, I joined a [research team](https://fordschool.umich.edu/mozambique-research/research-team) studying [The Economics of Health Decision-Making in Mozambique](https://fordschool.umich.edu/mozambique-research). At the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, the team - led by [Dean Yang](https://fordschool.umich.edu/faculty/dean-yang), a Professor in the Department of Economics and the Ford School of Public Policy at the [University of Michigan - Ann Arbor](https://umich.edu/) - conducted three rounds of over-the-phone health interventions and surveys with treatments to not only increase support and the practice of social distancing, but also to improve knowledge about COVID-19. As issues of COVID-19 vaccine uptake and hesitancy surfaced, the surveys then moved towards the goal of understanding vaccine decision making. Recently in 2022, we started to pilot a new intervention, [ProProgresso](https://fordschool.umich.edu/mozambique-research/pro-progresso), a community-level HIV/AIDS program in Mozambique aimed at increasing HIV testing and ART adherence.

Since joining the team, key outputs for which I provided research assistance/feedback include published papers on [Knowledge, Stigma, and HIV Testing](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S030438782200102X), and [Teaching and Incentives](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0272775722000905).

Besides my experience with the research in Mozambique, I have vast experience in fieldwork having been involved in various research teams in Malawi, where I am based. In 2019, while working with the World Bank office in Lilongwe as an Education Analyst Consultant, I was in a team that was conducting a large-scale Malawi Longitudinal School Survey - aimed at improving various educational outcomes in the country. This was done by conducting regular learning assessments with a representative, longitudinal sample of students who were in Grade 4 in 2016-18.

Before that, my experience with an economics consulting field in Malawi gave me the chance to appreciate issues of development through the various field trips I had between 2015 and 2017.

Below I share a pictorial mix of some of my past field experiences.
